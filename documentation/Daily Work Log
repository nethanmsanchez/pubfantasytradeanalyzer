Tuesday 10/5/21
-finished merging db_connection and statsScraper code
-successfully accessing db and getting webscraped data into main
-created Player object with getters, setters and printPlayer function
-need to figure out how to access Player.printPlayer() in main. Have to pass Player to main wrapped in a promise, which may be why i can't access the function in main.
-seems to be some sort of typing error.

Wednesday 10/20/21

    -seemed to get it working had to resolve some mixture of issues with: scope, promise

Tuesday 11/30/21
- starting deployment attempt 1

Wednesday 12/1/21
- working on deployment attempt 1 still
- was getting an error due to depreciated withRouter import. looked into it and I don't need to use
  withRouter as it was mainly used to allow me to change the react route from that component, which I
  never do. At some point I should go back and learn about the react router stuff in more detail.
- finally got ui to show up, needed to take out route part of App -> MainPage
    - look into why this didn't work, although it doesn't seem to be necessary
- now I need to figure out why axios call isn't working. figure it's something to do with proxy
- I finally got the it work fully !!!
- To work on: fix routing issues (server api calls & react component routing App -> MainPage),    make it look a little better on mobile, figure out how to update db daily automatically, clean up code, make sure it's secure-ish with package.json(license) & config.env stuff, fix ui for the winner as well

Sunday 12/5/21
- fixed route issue, changed mongo password and removed config.env from git

Tuesday 12/7/21
- updated ui, found out easy way to update db using windows task scheduler on windows, finished client files code clean-up
- tomorrow do: server/db file code clean-up, update and push public git hub repo

Wednesday 12/8/21
- finished cleaning up code, updated public repo, created README.txt

To-Do:
- make it look a little better on mobile (skipping for now, may fix later)
- clean up code
- update db daily automatically



In Progress:
-code searches players in db by name, need to figure out a way to make sure they search the correct name. ex in db Patrick Mahomes is listed as "Pat Mahomes" from the website data is pulled from. Need to make sure Patrick Mahomes will return same result.
    -resolution: So far I've implemented a autocomplete form that will show suggestions based on entered text. Still need to add styling to it (like highlighting when hovering over), make it display a message if trying to add without matching a valid string

Done:




To start app in local environment for testing:
After closing everything, to start the app, follow these steps.

Go into the server folder and run the command nodemon server.js.
Go back to the client folder and run the command npm start.
