Following guide from https://daveceddia.com/deploy-react-express-app-heroku/

The method keeps the backend and frontend together on one "machine", express serves the react files and also serves the api requests


Step 1: Create Heroku account

Step 2: Download Heroku CLI (command line interface) which comes with "toolbelt" from https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

Step 3: Create the Express App 
    - create parent directory that will contain everything. It can be named anything.
    - initialize the project with npm or yarn ($ npm init -y)
    - install express, cors, dotenv, mongodb, react-router-dom, react-responsive, axios,
      (took out dotenv because I don't think it's needed for deployment, may add later)

Step 4: Create index.js (just copied server.js)

Step 5: Move over Routes from other project and make sure all the folders (db, env.config, etc...) and paths are correct in new project

Step 6: Initialize git, add node_modules to .gitignore

Step 7: run heroku login and create commands
    - ($ heroku login)
    - ($ heroku create)

Step 8: git add, commit and push
    - git add and commit are the same as usual
    - to push use ($ git push heroku master)

Step 9: generate the react app
    - ($ create-react-app client)
    - ($ npm install -g create-react-app) if don't already have create-react-app

Step 10: add proxy to package.json
    - ("proxy": "http://localhost:5000")
    - this goes into the client/package.json, not the express package.json

Step 11: move over all react files needed and update paths in files if needed
